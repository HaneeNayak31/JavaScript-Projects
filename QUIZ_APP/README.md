# Quiz App 🧠

**Quiz App** is a simple, interactive general knowledge quiz game built with vanilla JavaScript. It tests users on various topics and provides instant feedback on their score.

## 🚀 About the Project

This application serves as a fun way to test knowledge. Users are presented with a series of multiple-choice questions. The app tracks the score and displays the final result upon completion. It demonstrates basic DOM manipulation and game logic implementation in JavaScript.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Interactive Quiz**: Engaging question-and-answer interface.
-   **Multiple Choice**: Select one answer from a list of options.
-   **Score Tracking**: Calculates the score as the user progresses.
-   **Final Score**: Displays the total score out of the number of questions at the end.
-   **Restart Functionality**: Option to retake the quiz to improve the score.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

-   **HTML5**: Markup for the quiz container and elements.
-   **CSS3**: Styling for layout and visual appeal.
-   **JavaScript (ES6)**: Logic for question navigation, answer checking, and score calculation.

## 🏗️ How It Works

1.  **Question Data**: Questions and answers are stored in an array of objects within the JavaScript code.
2.  **Navigation**: The "Next" button advances the user to the next question in the array.
3.  **State**: Variables track the `currentQuestionIndex` and the user's `score`.
4.  **Interaction**: Clicking an answer triggers a function to check if it matches the correct answer defined in the data object.
5.  **Completion**: When all questions are answered, the results screen is shown with the final score.
